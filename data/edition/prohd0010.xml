                <p>In the course of the Year 1802. Two hundred and four thousand <lb/>four hundred
                    and three Boxes of Sugars, were dispatched at the Custom house <lb/>of the
                    Havana of which, two fifths ought to be Browns and three fifths Whites <lb/>and
                    shoud weigh four hundred Pounds on an Average. Consequently, <lb/>The two fifths
                    Brown, being eighty one thousand, seven hundred Boxes sold <lb/>at six Dollars
                    per Quintal, amount to one Million, nine hundred and sixty thou<lb break="no"/>sand, eight hundred Dollars. And the three fifths Whites, one hundred and
                    <lb/>twenty two thousand, seven hundred and three Boxes at eight Dollars per

                    with the price paid for the Boxes <lb/>twenty six Reales each will be six

                    nine Dollars. Thus the two hundred and four thousand four hundred <lb/>and three
                    Boxes of Sugars legally shipped at the Havana in 1802 amount <lb/>to Six
                    millions. Five hundred and fifty one Thousand six hundred and <lb/>five Dollars:
                    Nett to the Planters, For, the Exporters paid the Duties, and <lb/>the Mollasses
                    paid amply for the Boxes.</p>
                <p>The produce of the Coffee, Cotton and other Plantations are not <lb/>brought into

                <p>We find from the intelligent Planters and Persons well informed <lb/>that we may

                    But, we cannot reckon <lb/>on such an increase, by reason of a Drought, which
